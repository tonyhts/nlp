data_loader.py

This module contains functions for loading data from different sources, 
including CSV files, Pickle files, XLS files, and PostgreSQL databases.
Please note that the code and data in this repository have been modified 
for confidentiality purposes, preserving the sensitive details of the project 
that generated the article.
As a result, some functions may appear more generic, but they are fully functional 
and demonstrate all the concepts discussed in the article.

Functions:
- load_csv(file_path): Loads data from a CSV file.
- load_pickle(file_path): Loads data from a Pickle file.
- load_xls(file_path): Loads data from an XLS file.
- load_postgres(config_file): Loads data from a PostgreSQL database.

Example Usage:
data_csv = load_csv('data.csv')
data_pickle = load_pickle('data.pickle')
data_xls = load_xls('data.xls')
data_postgres = load_postgres('postgres_config.json')

Authors: This code was developed by the Data Science Laboratory at the Polytechnic School 
of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, led by researchers Wellingthon Queiroz and Osvaldo Gogliano, 
as described in the article.
