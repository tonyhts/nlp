This module contains functions for identifying occurrences in a description field. It uses a trained
classifier model to predict whether a description contains an occurrence or not. Please note that the 
code and data in this repository have been modified for confidentiality purposes, preserving the sensitive 
details of the project that generated the article. As a result, some functions may appear more generic, 
but they are fully functional and demonstrate all the concepts discussed in the article.

Functions:
- load_model(model_path): Loads the trained classifier model from a file.
- identify_occurrences(descriptions, model): Identifies occurrences in a list of descriptions using a 
  trained model.
- run_identification(data, description_column, model_path): Runs the identification process on a dataset.

Example Usage:
data = load_csv('data.csv')
model = load_model('classifier_model.pkl')
identified_occurrences = identify_occurrences(data['description'], model)

Authors: This code was developed by the Data Science Laboratory at the Polytechnic School 
of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, led by researchers Wellingthon Queiroz and Osvaldo Gogliano, 
as described in the article.
