classifier.py

This module contains functions for training and evaluating a classifier on preprocessed text data.
It includes functionality for loading data, preprocessing, splitting into train and test sets, training a classifier,
and evaluating the accuracy of the classifier.

Please note that the code and data in this repository have been modified for confidentiality purposes, preserving the
sensitive details of the project that generated the article. As a result, some functions may appear more generic,
but they are fully functional and demonstrate all the concepts discussed in the article.

Functions:
- train_classifier(X_train, y_train): Trains a classifier on the given training data.
- evaluate_classifier(model, X_test, y_test): Evaluates the accuracy of the trained classifier on the given test data.
- run_classification(input_file): Loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, splits into train and test sets,
  trains a classifier, and evaluates its accuracy.

Example Usage:
run_classification('data.csv')

Authors: This code was developed by the Data Science Laboratory at the Polytechnic School
of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, led by researchers Wellingthon Queiroz and Osvaldo Gogliano,
as described in the article.
