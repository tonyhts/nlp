match_ocorrencias.py

This module contains functions for matching the identified occurrences with the data from the instrumented wagon. 
It performs the matching based on common fields, such as longitude, latitude, and timestamp. Please note that the 
code and data in this repository have been modified for confidentiality purposes, preserving the sensitive 
details of the project that generated the article. As a result, some functions may appear more generic, 
but they are fully functional and demonstrate all the concepts discussed in the article.

Functions:
- match_occurrences_with_data(occurrences, instrumented_data): Matches the identified occurrences with the instrumented data.
- run_matching(occurrence_file, instrumented_data_file, output_file): Runs the matching process on the occurrence file
  and the instrumented data file.

Example Usage:
run_matching('identified_occurrences.csv', 'instrumented_data.csv', 'matched_data.csv')

Authors: This code was developed by the Data Science Laboratory at the Polytechnic School 
of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, led by researchers Wellingthon Queiroz and Osvaldo Gogliano, 
as described in the article.
